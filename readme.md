# Comic Book Browser
The story behind this project is that I have a bunch of .cbr files in a directory. Sometimes it feels like a pain to browse them all, so I'm developing a small little application that will display them all nicely. It'll take the cover of each file (the first image) and display them in a grid like view.

# The basics
The most basic functionality of this thing will be the ability to display the comics in a grid-like view, allowing the user to make sense of large amounts of files. When one of these covers is clicked, the default application on the system will open the file.

# Potential Features
Depending on how fast I get tired of working on this, the following features may or may not be added

## Ordering Feature
Sometimes my .cbr reader gets mixed up with the order of comics for some odd reason. This project will allow the user to explicitly state the order in which the comics are supposed to be in. In retrospect, this feature will be useless without the next...

## Built-in .cbr Reader
It would be nice if organzing and reading could all be done in a single application.

## Tagging System
To make locating files even easier, there could be a tagging system of sorts
